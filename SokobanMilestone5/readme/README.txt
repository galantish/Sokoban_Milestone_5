Hello!

Welcome to my Pac-Ban game.
please choose one of the following options:
1. Run the "RunPacban.bat" file if you want to play this game 
   without server.
2. Run the "RunPacbanWithServer.bat" file and after that run the 
   "RunPacbanClient.bat" file if you want to play with a server.
* You can run the client file from one computer and run the server file
  from another computer. 
* If there is a broblem on opening the server file, 
  please open both files by editor (notepad) and change the last number,
  this is the port number, and it could be caught.

Pay attantion!
* DB details: SokobanDB (Microsoft SQLServer).
* If there is a problem with the tables, there is a query that creates all the tables.
* Please copy the sql dll file to c:\windows\system32.

HAVE FUN :)
